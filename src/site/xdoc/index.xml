  <section name="What Is Apache James Mailbox?">
    <p>The Apache James Mailbox is a library providing a flexible Mailbox storage accessible by mail 
       protocols (IMAP4, POP3, SMTP,...) and other protocols.</p>
    <p>It can also be embedded into your application to implement for example 
       the <a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~mgrand/pattern_synopses3.htm#Mailbox">Mailbox Pattern</a>.</p>
    <p>The mailbox library supports different persistence 
       mechanisms: MailDir, SQL Database via Apache OpenJPA and JCR (Java Content Repository) via Apache JackRabbit.</p>
    <p>We are also planning to implement distributed persistence such as Hadoop 
       and NoSQL storage systems 
       (see <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAILBOX-44">MAILBOX-44</a> and
       <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAILBOX-45">MAILBOX-45</a>).</p>
    <p>You can <a href="http://james.apache.org/download.cgi">download</a> current 
       0.2-M2 milestone. The <a href="apidocs/">API</a> as the Database schema are susceptible to evolve 
       (see for example <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAILBOX-46">MAILBOX-46</a>).</p>

  <section name="Apache James Mailbox in Server and other librairies">
    <p><a href="http://james.apache.org/server/3">Apache James Server 3</a> uses this library to implement its user mailboxes.
       A backport to <a href="http://james.apache.org/server/2">Apache James Server 2.3.2</a> would require
       a volunteer.</p>
    <p>The Mailbox is tested and fully compatible with other Apache James libraries
       such as the <a href="http://james.apache.org/imap">Apache James IMAP</a> (see <a href="https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/james/mailbox-integration-tester/trunk/">this link</a> for the Mailbox/IMAP tests source code) </p>
